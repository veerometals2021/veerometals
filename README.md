Metal 3D Printing(DMLS) or Metal Additive manufacturing is an augmented cutting-edge technology which produces three-dimensional parts layer by layer from a metal material. Metal 3D Printing technology makes it possible for manufacturers to produce complex parts without any design constraints of traditional manufacturing. The technology allows rapid manufacturing and rapid prototyping of complex end-use parts by overcoming the design constraints, traditional machine tools and special tools. It also reduces the lead-time in manufacturing cycles and raw material wastage.
